\section{Validating a phylogenetic Brownian motion simulator}

One commonly used model in macroevolution for the study of continuous traits is the phylogenetic Brownian motion model (``PhyloBM'' in Fig. 1 of the main text; \citealt{fel73}).
The pdf characterizing this model's sampling distribution is in fact the pdf of the multivariate normal (MVN) probability distribution:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \text{log }f(\boldsymbol{y} \mid \boldsymbol{y_0}, r, \boldsymbol{T}) = -\frac{1}{2} \Big[ n\text{log}(2\pi) + \text{log}|r \boldsymbol{T}| \Big] & \\
    -\frac{1}{2} \Big[ (\mathbf{y} - \boldsymbol{y_0})^T (r \boldsymbol{T})^{-1} (\mathbf{y} - \boldsymbol{y_0}) \Big].
  \label{eq:bm}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent This probability density function describes the distribution obtained from an infinite number of BM ``experiments'' (each experiment being non-mean-reverting, and representing an independent evolutionary trajectory).
Under this model, one has data $d = \{\boldsymbol{y}\}$ and parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta} = \{\boldsymbol{y_0}, r, \boldsymbol{T}\}$ (sometimes researchers treat $\phi$ and consequently $\boldsymbol{T}$ as data instead of as a parameter).

The data, $\boldsymbol{y}$, corresponds to the observed values of a trait scored for $n$ species.
Among the parameters, $\boldsymbol{y_0}$ is the trait value at the root of the tree, $r$ is the instantaneous rate of change (i.e., the evolutionary rate, and sometimes represented by $\sigma^2$), and $\boldsymbol{T}$ is a matrix whose elements are deterministically defined by tree $\phi$'s topology and branch lengths.
Matrix $r\boldsymbol{T}$ is also known as the variance-covariance matrix; as an example, such matrix in supplementary figure \ref{fig:bmsim} would evaluate to:

\begin{equation}
  r\boldsymbol{T} = 0.1
  \begin{bmatrix}
    6 & 5 & 0\\
    5 & 6 & 0\\
    0 & 0 & 6
  \end{bmatrix}
  \label{eq:mat}
\end{equation}

\noindent Together with $\boldsymbol{y_0} = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]$, this matrix characterizes a population of phylogenetically related species trait values whose means are 0.0, variances are 6.0, and co-variances are 5.0 (between species ``A'' and ``B'') and 0.0 (between species ``C''and either ``A'' or ``B'').
Supplementary figure \ref{fig:bmsim} shows the distributions of trait values and their variances and covariances for one sample of one thousand independent realizations of phylogenetic BM processes. 
One can see that the sample's average trait value and the variances and covariances approach their expectations. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=11cm]{../figures/phylobm_exp_vcv.pdf}
  \caption{A sample of 1000 draws from a MVN distribution, each representing the evolutionary trajectory of one continuous trait along the species tree on the left.
    The root trait value, $\boldsymbol{y_0}$, and the evolutionary rate of the process, $r$, were set to 0.0 and 0.1, respectively.
    The panel on the right shows histograms of 1000 trait values sampled from the MVN for each species, as well as their covariation.}
  \label{fig:bmsim}
\end{figure}

More rigorously, one can follow the method described in the main text -- as we do in what follows -- and verify that those expectations fall within their 95\%-confidence intervals 95\% of the time, as calculated from a large number of samples (Supplementary Fig. \ref{supfig:bmsimcis} and Supplementary Table \ref{suptab:bmsimcis}).
Here, we will verify that the expected value of certain summary statistics (given a specific combination of parameter values) falls within its $\alpha$-confidence intervals approximately $\alpha$\% of the time.
We will build confidence intervals about statistics calculated from several PhyloBM samples of size 10,000, and then ask if the ``population'' value of  a statistic -- given by the parameters of the multivariate normal sampling distribution -- is contained within its confidence interval frequently enough.

For summary statistics, we pay attention to the trait value's (i) species mean, (ii) species variance, (iii) among-species covariance, and (iv) among-species correlation coefficient.
Supplementary figure \ref{supfig:bmsimcis} shows one hundred confidence intervals for each of these statistics, under multivariate normal $\text{MVN}(\boldsymbol{y_0},r\boldsymbol{T})$, where $\boldsymbol{y_0}=\{0,0,0\}$, $r=0.1$ and $\boldsymbol{T}$ is given by the tree in Fig. 2 in the main text.
Supplementary table \ref{suptab:bmsimcis} summarizes how often each statistic fell within its 95\%-confidence interval.
These results indicate the PhyloBM simulator produces appropriate confidence intervals and behaves as expected.

\section{Model validation with rejection sampling: a simple example}
\label{sec:supp_toy}

In this section, we experiment with a simple hierarchical Gaussian (toy) model to further examine the effect of rejection sampling in coverage validation and
rank-uniformity validation (RUV).
This experiment is motivated by results described in the main text, namely, the model in scenario 3 (Fig. 1, with extreme rejection sampling) passing coverage validation but not RUV.

Let us devise the following data-generating process for obtaining different levels of model misspecification:

\begin{align*}
 \mu & \sim \operatorname{Normal}\left(0, 1\right)T[t, ],\\
  y_1, \ldots, y_K & \overset{\text{iid}}{\sim} \operatorname{Normal}\left(\mu, 1\right),
\end{align*}
where $K$ is the sample size, and notation $T[, t]$ indicates the distribution is truncated \textbf{below} at $t \in \mathbb{R}$, i.e.,
\begin{equation*}
    \pi_{t}(\mu) = \frac{\phi(\mu)}{1 - \Phi(t)} \mathbb{I}(\mu > t).
\end{equation*}
and $\phi$ and $\Phi$ are the pdf and CDF of a standard normal, respectively.
Here, $\mu$ and $y_1, \ldots, y_K$ correspond to $\theta_i$ and $d_i$ in Fig. 4 (main text), respectively.

Inference is then done under the misspecified model
\begin{align*}
 \mu & \sim \operatorname{Normal}\left(0, 1\right),\\
  y_1, \ldots, y_K & \overset{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim} \operatorname{Normal}\left(\mu, 1\right).
\end{align*}
It is well-known that:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:toy_normal_posterior}
    \mu \mid y_1, \ldots, y_K \sim \operatorname{Normal}\left( \frac{\sum_{k = 1}^K y_k}{K + 1},  \frac{1}{K + 1} \right),
\end{equation}
i.e., the posterior is known in closed-form so MCMC is not required and one can sample directly and independently from it.
One can thus control how extreme the model misspecification will be during inference by increasing $t$.
Here we explore $t =  \{0, 1, 1.5\}$ and $K = \{5, 10 , 50\}$ in order to show how the method behaves in various misspecification scenarios.
We ran $n=1000$ replications of the experiment, draw $200$ i.i.d. samples directly from the posterior in (\ref{eq:toy_normal_posterior}).

The resulting rank histograms (Supplementary Fig.~\ref{supfig:ruv_normal_toy}) show how the posterior consistently underestimates the true mean, as indicated by a pattern of ranks bunching up towards the right-hand side of the histogram.
The pattern is clearer in situations where the evidence in the data is weaker (e.g., when $K$ is small), and the effect of the prior on the posterior is stronger.
Moreover, the misspecification becomes more apparent the larger $t$ is, that is, the more extreme the misspecification becomes.

It is worth noting a couple of things.
First, unlike what we observed and reported for the model in the main text, coverage validation does suggest an incorrectly specified model for certain combinations of $t$ and $K$ (Supplementary Table 2).
Second, when the truncation is less extreme ($t = 0$) and there is a substantial amount of data ($K = 50$), RUV fails to detect any problems.
This is an important insight about validation protocols: their sensitivity is context-dependent, and responds to the combination of model and data regime.

  Results are based on $n=1000$ replicates of $L= 200$ i.i.d. draws each.
  Horizontal black lines shows the expected count for each rank (the same for all ranks due to uniformity), and the light-blue bands represent the 95\%-confidence interval for the counts.

\section{Validating a phylogenetic model with respect to a phylogenetic tree parameter, $\Phi$}
\label{sec::app::ruv_topology}

Our goal is to evaluate if an inferential implementation of model $\mathcal{M}$, $\text{I}[\mathcal{M}]$, is well-calibrated and correct.
In this section, we will focus on one critical parameter of $\mathcal{M}$: the phylogenetic tree $\Phi$.
We will pay special attention to $\Phi$ while carrying out coverage validation and the RUV procedure.
In practice, this amounts to computing the coverage of $\Phi$ and the rank distribution of this parameter in comparison to its posterior samples.

What feature of $\Phi$ should one use when calculating coverage and ranks?
Because of the nature of tree space, summarizing and comparing phylogenetic trees with univariate measures is not a trivial task.
The key to an effective validation effort is to choose a functional that reflects relevant estimators of the quantity of interest, in our case, $\Phi$.
Fortunately, it is possible to exploit the metric nature of tree space and compute quantities both from a sampled phylogenetic tree $\phi$ -- i.e., the ``true'' tree simulated during the validation process -- as well as distances with respect to a reference phylogeny $\phi_0$.
We summarize some of these distances in supplementary table \ref{suptab:dists}.

\begin{table}[h]
  \caption{Metrics (functionals) for investigating model correctness in phylogenetic tree space. $\phi$ is a (phylogenetic tree) sample of $\Phi$, sampled from a tree model (e.g., a Yule process).
  $\phi_0$ is a reference tree to which $\phi$ and its posterior samples (see Algorithm 1 and the RUV section in the main text) are being compared, with respect to any of the metrics in the table.
  For the KC metric, the parameter ($\omega$) controls the balance between topological and branch length information, and was set at $\omega = 0.5$. }
  \label{suptab:dists}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ l|c|c }
    \hline
    \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Metric} & Notation & Ref. \\
    \hline  
    \rowcolor{gray!10}The largest branch length in $\phi$ & $\text{LB}(\phi)$ & N/A\\
    The length of $\phi$ (the sum of all branch lengths) & $\text{LEN}(\phi)$ & N/A\\
    % \rowcolor{gray!10}The length of the external branch leading to taxon $s_1$ & $\text{T}_1(\phi)$ & N/A\\
    \rowcolor{gray!10}The difference between the largest and smallest branch length of $\phi$ & $\text{R}(\phi)$ & N/A\\
    The Robinson-Foulds distance between $\phi$ and $\phi_0$ & $\text{RF}_0(\phi)$ & \citep{rf81}\\
    \rowcolor{gray!10}The Kendall-Coljin distance between $\phi$ and $\phi_0$ & $\text{KC}_0(\phi;\omega)$ & \citep{Kendall2016}\\
    The Billera-Holmes-Vogtman distance between $\phi$ and $\phi_0$ & $\text{BHV}_0(\phi)$ & \citep{Billera2001}\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

In the case of tree-space distance metrics, we must slightly modify our RUV procedure (Algorithm 1).
The key difference is the sampling of a reference phylogenetic tree, $\phi_0$, prior to the simulation of the $n$ i.i.d. $\Phi$ samples, $\boldsymbol{\phi}=\{\phi_i: 1 \leq i \leq n\}$.
Given a reference tree $\phi_0$, each sampled $\phi_i$ and all of its $L$ posterior MCMC samples are then compared to $\phi_0$ with respect to a chosen distance metric.
It is the evaluated distance metric that will underlie the ranking of $\phi_i$ relative to its posterior MCMC samples.
Once ranks are computed, RUV proceeds as usual.

Supplementary figures \ref{supfig:treecov} and \ref{supfig:ruv} summarize the coverage and RUV results, respectively, for the metrics listed in supplementary table \ref{suptab:dists}, when the model is the simple Kingman's coalescent.
The model consists of a single five-taxon phylogenetic tree parameter, $\Phi$, assuming a known effective population size of 1.0.

We can first verify that our model implementation is well-calibrated with respect to the phylogenetic tree parameter, as shown by appropriate 95\%-HPD-coverage statistics over the different tree metrics (Supplementary Fig. \ref{supfig:treecov}).
The evidence for implementation correctness is enhanced by observing that the ranks for the different metrics are (approximately) uniformly distributed, lying inside their confidence bands (Supplementary Fig. \ref{supfig:ruv}a), and their corresponding ECDFs also lie well inside their confidence ellipses (Supplementary Fig. \ref{supfig:ruv}b).
% Supplementary figure \ref{supfig:phylo_calibration} shows that the HPDs do cover the
% generating metrics with probability compatible with what is expected
% theoretically.
% In this instance, the tests would fail to detect problems with the algorithm.
% These plots can be supplemented with a table showing attained coverage and binomial confidence intervals for this quantity.
% A further advantage of graphically investigating coverage is that one can identify consistent areas for which estimation fails -- e.g. high/low simulated values of a given variable.

In the main text, we also mentioned the possibility of assessing the coverage of a phylogenetic tree's topology; specifically, by looking at the frequency of its clades as a function of their posterior support.
An outcome of this procedure can be seen in supplementary figure \ref{supfig:clade_covg}, for a simple 50-sample Kingman coalescent model.
We propose that the clade frequency diagnostic is further evaluated in two ways.
First, one can check that the resulting empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) fits that of an appropriately scaled uniform distribution using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test~\citep{Birnbaum1951}.
Second, one can fit a regression model to the attained frequencies against the bin midpoints, and test the null hypothesis that the intercept is zero and the slope is one, rejecting it at the usual confidence levels.

\section{Proof for coverage validation}
 \label{appendix::sec:proofs}

In this section we provide a mathematical argument that coverage-based validation is sound, i.e., that sampling from the prior, simulating data and then using the same prior for computing the posterior should give Bayesian credible intervals (BCIs) with nominal frequentist coverage.

For a number $n$ of replicates, simulate parameter
  values $\theta_i$, and then given those values, simulate data $d_i$:

\begin{align*}
\theta_i & \sim f_\Theta(\cdot), \\
d_i & \sim f_{D|\Theta}(\cdot | \Theta=\theta_i).
\end{align*}

Now for notational convenience, define $a_i := a(d_i, \alpha)$ as the HPD lower bound and, similarly, $b_i := b(d_i, \alpha)$ as the HPD upper bound.
Recall $I_{\alpha}\left(d_i\right)$ is such that:


\begin{align*}
Q_{d_i}\left(b_i\right) - Q_{d_i}\left(a_i\right) = p_1 - p_2 = \alpha,
\end{align*}

\noindent where $Q_{d}(x)$ is the posterior CDF (conditional on data $d$) and $p_1, p_2 \in (0,1)$, with $p_1 < p_2$.
A natural quantity to compute is:

\begin{align*}
S_n = n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{I}\left(\theta_i \in I_{\alpha}\left(d_i\right) \right),
\end{align*}

\noindent i.e., the attained coverage of the Bayesian intervals.

Let $F_U(x) = x$ be the CDF of a $\operatorname{Uniform(0, 1)}$ random variable. 
Now we can consider what happens when the number of simulations grows, i.e., the limit $\lim_{n \to \infty} S_n$.
We may re-write the limit as:

\begin{align*}
\lim_{n \to \infty} S_n &= \lim_{n \to \infty} n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{I}\left(\theta_i \in I_{\alpha}\left(d_i\right) \right),\\
&=  \lim_{n \to \infty} n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n \left\{ \mathbb{I}\left(\theta_i \leq b_i \right) - \mathbb{I}\left(\theta_i \leq a_i \right) \right\},\\
&=  \lim_{n \to \infty} n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{I}\left(\theta_i \leq b_i \right) -  n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n\mathbb{I}\left(\theta_i \leq a_i \right),\\
&=  \lim_{n \to \infty} n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{I}\left(Q_{d_i}^{-1}\left(\theta_i\right) \leq p_1 \right) -   \lim_{n \to \infty} n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n\mathbb{I}\left(Q_{d_i}^{-1}\left(\theta_i\right) \leq p_2 \right),\\
&= F_U(p_1) - F_U(p_2) = \alpha,
\end{align*}

\noindent where the last line follows from the fact that the CDF of $\theta_i$ is uniformly distributed on $(0, 1$) (Theorem 1 in \citealp{Cook06}) and almost sure convergence of the ECDF to the true CDF due to the  Glivenko-Cantelli theorem~\cite[page 275]{Billingsley1986}.

  \caption{Rank-uniformity validation (RUV) of the Bayesian hierarchical model in Fig. 1 in the main text.
    Panels in the top row show the histograms of $n=100$ ranks, for parameter $\Lambda$ in each scenario, obtained after 10\% burnin and thinning of posterior samples down to 200 out of 10,000.
    Panels in the bottom row show the corresponding ECDF plots, for parameter $\Lambda$ in each scenario.
    (a) In ``Scenario 1'', the model was correctly specified, and we simulated trees with 3 to 300 taxa using rejection sampling (approximately one in ten trees were rejected).
    (b) In ``Scenario 2'', the model was incorrectly specified in inference (see main text), and we used the same data sets simulated in ``Scenario 1''.
    (c) In ``Scenario 3'', the model was correctly specified, but rejection sampling was more intense (we rejected a large number of trees, approximately 90\%, keeping those having between 100 to 200 tips).
